# Introduction 
Introduction (5%  ~200 words)
Describe what makes the new level in your game novel.

The previous game is a 2D platform game which, like other similar 2D platforms, allows for a character to jump through obstacles, avoiding enemies and collecting points. 
I added a new feature based on the previous game: the teleport stone. When the player touches the teleport stone, they will be teleported to the specified location for a period of time and then teleported back to the starting point, or they will be teleported to the specified location but not teleported back. The specific function of the teleport stone depends on whether it is the first time or the second time to touch the stone. The first time to touch the stone, the player will be teleported to the specified location for a period of time and then teleported back to the starting point, while the second time to touch the stone, the player will be teleported to the specified location but will not be teleported back

# Process

Process (15% ~200 words)
Reflect on your work process, in particular:
 explaining what tools you used and their strengths and limitations
how different it would have been working in a team rather than working on your own? 
how you could have improved your performance in the previous team work. 


## Introduction



## Inception

In our initial team meeting, attended by Hamza, GunHo, Yiran, Feng, and Lu, we brainstormed potential game concepts, prioritising personal passion over feasibility. We subsequently narrowed our focus to 2D platformers, dismissing more complex ideas like 3D and online multiplayer games due to time constraints.

**Challenges** during this phase**:**

- Varied coding skills and GitHub familiarity among team members.
- Role assignment.

**Solutions:**

- Each member developed and presented a simple game in Processing, enhancing our understanding of individual coding skills and fostering team cohesion through **pair programming** and feedback.
- We conducted a GitHub tutorial. For example, one of the team members (GunHo) had significantly more GitHub experience than the rest of the team. So we had all team members (Hamza, GunHo, and Yiran present) go through a tutorial on branching, merging, and rebasing. We did this by ‘practice’ codes that we pushed onto git, where each member practised creating their branch, merging code and resolving conflicts.
